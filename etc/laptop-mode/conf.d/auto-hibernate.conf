# Auto-hibernation settings
# -------------------------
#
#__COMMENT Using these settings, you can make laptop mode tools automatically put your
#__COMMENT computer into hibernation when the battery level goes critically low.
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT This feature only works on ACPI, and only works on computers whose batteries
#__COMMENT give off battery events often enough.
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT NOTE: If your battery does NOT give off battery events often enough, you can
#__COMMENT enable the battery-level-polling module to make this work after all. See
#__COMMENT battery-level-polling.conf for more information.
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT IMPORTANT: In versions 1.36 and earlier, these settings were included in the
#__COMMENT main laptop-mode.conf configuration file. If they are still present, they
#__COMMENT overrule the settings in this file. To fix this, simply delete the settings
#__COMMENT from the main config file.
