## Specs & Configuration

The links in the following text lead to my configuration files and other interesting information.

Currently my main machine is a [Dell XPS 7590][laptop].
I run [Arch Linux][arch] and use [yay][yay] as a package manager wrapper.
I use [i3][i3] as my tiling manager (desktop environment) with [i3bar][i3bar] [picom][picom] as a composite manager.
My shell is [Zsh][zsh] with [zinit][zinit] as my shell plugin manager.
[Alacritty][alacritty] is my terminal emulator with [tmux][tmux] on top for terminal window management.
