When discussing a feature or issue, look at .papertrail/ directory for the mentioned GitHub issue, and read all of relevant instructions and files in order to understand all the context you need.

For example, if discussing "issue #111" which talks about "adding rendering videos via blender", look for the number "111" or for anything mentioning rendering, videos, or bledner in any directory or file under .papertrail.

See the plan and github issue guidelines cursor rule for additional rules on how to format .papertrail files when necessary.
